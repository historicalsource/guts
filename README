Enclosed you will find the following 4 files which are built and used as libraries:

cled.tar	- Interactive command line editor
glide.tar	- 2.1.1 glide
libz.tar	- compression/decompression library
nsprintf.tar	- nsprintf functions (also include nisprintf
			which is an integer only version, although
			it isn't used by any of the 5k games)

The following two are sources for the selftest code:

comp.tar	- code that decompresses the EPROM image and boots it
os.tar		- selftest code

The following are executables for some utilities that
these procedures use:

utils.tar	- DOS and Linux versions of macpp and sources to elf2zo.
		  (I didn't include the sources for macpp because I don't
		   believe you have a hope in hell of getting it to
		   compile in your environment; I won't testify that the
		   DOS macpp will handle all of the .mac files that it may
		   be needed for; you will also need to compile a
		   version of libz for your environment to link with elf2zo)

The procedure is to make directories for each of these:

mkdir cled glide libz nsprintf comp os utils
cd to and de-tar the respective .tar file into each directory.

You will undoubtably need to edit (or rewrite) the makefile (or Makefile) in
each directory to meet your needs. Most of the makefiles depend heavily on the
extensions to GNU's make.

Make all the libraries first.
Make os.elf in the os directory next.
Make decompbt.elf in the comp directory which depends on the os.elf
	file having already been made.

convert the decompbt.elf to an EPROM image and burn it into an
eprom.

If you need the C libraries too (m, c and gcc), let me know and I'll send them
along later.
